# JavaScript Design Patterns Repository

This project demonstrates implementations of the 23 **Gang of Four (GoF)** design patterns using **JavaScript**, specifically optimized for **JavaScript applications**. Developers can enhance their code quality, promote reusability, and build robust applications by understanding and applying these patterns.

**Design patterns** are time-tested solutions to recurring problems in software development. The **Gang of Four (GoF)**, consisting of **Erich Gamma**, **Richard Helm**, **Ralph Johnson**, and **John Vlissides**, introduced **23 fundamental design patterns** in their renowned book *"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"*.

This repository provides **JavaScript examples** of these patterns, serving as a practical reference for developers.

## Design Pattern Categories

### Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns focus on **object creation mechanisms**, enhancing flexibility and reuse in the instantiation process.

| Pattern Name                                                                           | Description                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **[Singleton](./patterns/creational/singleton/singleton.implementation.js)**           | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.                                         |
| **[Factory Method](./patterns/creational/factory-method/factory-method.implementation.js)** | Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of object that will be created.  |
| **Abstract Factory**                                                                   | Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. |
| **Builder**                                                                            | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.                                           |
| **Prototype**                                                                          | Creates new objects by copying an existing object (prototype).                                                   |

### Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns **simplify the design** by identifying simple ways to **realize relationships between entities**.

| Pattern Name    | Description                                                                                                           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adapter**     | Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.                                                           |
| **Composite**   | Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.                                             |
| **Proxy**       | Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.                                       |
| **Flyweight**   | Minimizes memory usage by sharing common data across multiple objects.                                                 |
| **Facade**      | Provides a simplified interface to a larger and more complex body of code.                                             |
| **Bridge**      | Separates abstraction from implementation, allowing both to evolve independently.                                      |
| **Decorator**   | Dynamically adds behavior or responsibilities to an object without modifying its structure.                           |

### Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on **communication between objects**, promoting **loose coupling** and **flexibility**.

| Pattern Name              | Description                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Template Method**        | Defines the program skeleton in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.                                |
| **Mediator**               | Defines an object that centralizes communication between components.                                         |
| **Chain of Responsibility**| Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it.                                             |
| **Observer**               | Defines a dependency between objects so that when one changes state, all dependents are notified.            |
| **Strategy**               | Defines a family of algorithms and lets the client choose which one to use at runtime.                      |
| **Command**                | Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization and queuing of requests.                     |
| **State**                  | Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.                                     |
| **Visitor**                | Separates an algorithm from the objects it operates on.                                                     |
| **Interpreter**            | Defines a grammar and an interpreter to process that grammar.                                                |
| **Iterator**               | Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation.|
| **Memento**                | Captures an objectâ€™s state so it can be restored later without violating encapsulation.                    |
